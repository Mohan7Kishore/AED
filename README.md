# AED
An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a portable device that delivers an electric shock to the heart to help restore normal rhythm in the event of sudden cardiac arrest. AEDs are designed to be easy to use by non-medical personnel and are often found in public places such as airports, schools, and offices.
